I'm working on a handful of projects about the history of MARC, and one of the things that would be really useful to me is a good, concise history of the family of MARC formats. I haven't been able to find quite what I'm looking for, so I decided to make it!
<!--more-->

The timeline below is my first, very imperfect attempt at mapping out the big markers in the history of MARC.  A couple of caveats: it is very much the result of my interests and my knowledge (other people would likely highlight other milestones); it is very US-centric (given my familiarity with and interest in MARC21 and USMARC); it is incomplete (I know it is missing things, and hopefully I will add to it over time). I also don't love this timeline format, but I decided to use this simple but unlovely Wordpress plugin until I find something better.

I'd love feedback, suggestions, criticism, etc.  Tell me what I've forgotten, point me to other sources, correct me on things I got wrong!  But in the meantime, please enjoy the history of our goofy but lovable data format.
