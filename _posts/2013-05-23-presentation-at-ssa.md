This morning, I am presenting my first-ever talk at a professional conference!  This week is the <a href="http://societyofsouthwestarchivists.wildapricot.org/events?eventId=511692&amp;EventViewMode=EventDetails" target="_blank">Society of Southwest Archivists</a> annual meeting here in Austin, and I am giving a talk entitled "Web Archiving for University Records" on a panel about digital records in university archives.  I'm a little nervous, but glad to be giving a presentation at a conference that everyone says is friendly and welcoming.  Plus it doesn't hurt to have the home court advantage!

An interest in web archiving is something that I have fallen into somewhat by accident, but through several projects this past year, I had the chance to delve into it.  Working on this presentation was a great opportunity to synthesize some of my thinking about web archiving, and to realize how much more I have to learn about it.

I've posted the slides from my presentation, as well as some related links, <a title="“Web Archiving for University Records,” Society of Southwest Archivists, May 2013" href="https://elliotdwilliams.com/ssa-web-archiving/">here</a>.  I'm looking forward to getting feedback after the talk, and I'd love to hear your thoughts here, as well.
